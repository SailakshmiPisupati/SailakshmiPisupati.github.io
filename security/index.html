				<h2>Black Chamber and MI8 come into existance.</h2>
				<p>The Black Chamber, also known as The Cipher Bureau, was the United States' first peacetime cryptanalytic organization, and a forerunner of the National Security Agency. The only prior codes and cypher organizations maintained by the US government had been some intermittent, and always abandoned, attempts by Armed Forces branches prior to World War I. US government created Military Intelligence branch which is MI8 in order to decipher German telegraph messages. After World War 1, they where shut and worked in hidding as Black Chamber.

				<h2>President Clinton signed a Presidential Decision Directive, PDD-39, titled “U.S. Policy on Counterterrorism</h2>
				<p>The question of national infrastructure rose after the a gang blew up the federal office bhuilding in Oklahama City, killing 168 people, injuring 600 more, and destroying or damaging 325 buildings across a sixteen-block radius, causing more than $600 million in damage. The shocking thing that emerged from the subsequent investigation showed that the security around the building was practically nonexistent. The need to protect the infrastructure rose and thus the "US Policy on Counterterrorism was signed."</p>

				<h2>Twenty-five members of an NSA “Red Team” launched an exercise called Eligible Receiver</h2>
				<p>They hacked into the computer networks of the Department of Defense, using only commercially available equipment and software. It was the first high-level exercise esting whether the U.S. military’s leaders, facilities, and global combatant commands were prepared for a cyber attack. Eligible Receiver was the brainchild of Kenneth Minihan, an Air Force three-star general who, not quite a year and a half earlier, had succeeded Mike McConnell as director of the NSA. Six months before then, in August 1995, he’d been made director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the culmination of a career in military intel.</p>

				<h2>Department of Energy conducted an experiment—called the Aurora Generator Test</h2>
				<p>In the internet era, one question always remained unanswered regarding the security of physical assests of the country. Marsh report had pointed the vulnerabilities in the area of electrical power grid, oil and gas pipelines, dams, railroads and other critical infrastruture that are being controlled by computers run on commercial systems. An attack on this asset can pose to become a threat to the national asset. The Aurora Generator Test was thus conducted to check the security of national assets.
